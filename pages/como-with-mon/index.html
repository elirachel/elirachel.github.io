    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8"><p>My dear friend, Monica, lives in Columbia, Missouri. We overlapped in college; she was two years ahead of me; we had multiple mutual friends. But for whatever reason, we didn't ever connect. It probably had to do with different schedules and the fact that we are very different people. I'm crazy and sometimes overwhelmingly outgoing; she sometimes seems brooding and slightly intimidating. It just never happened.
      </p>
      <p>So, when I moved down to St. Louis (a couple hours away from Mon), a bunch of our mutual friends encouraged me to connect with her. I was hesitant because I remembered her as really cool and because I wasn't in the best state of mind at that point, having recently moved to help take care of my family and dealing with the grief that comes with family medical trauma. Monica was my first “friend of a friend” travel connection. We visited each other a few times while I was living in Missouri and we now get along famously. Back on the road, I wanted to stop to visit her in the little city of Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>Columbia, Missouri, or CoMo as it is fondly called by locals (or at least by Monica the local), is a small, liberal oasis in the mostly conservative Missouri. So when I went for a run, expecting to go 4 miles and get a brief look at the downtown area, I didn't think that getting lost would cost me so much time. I took a wrong turn and accidentally ran NINE MILES. Before you roll your eyes at the dedicated and disciplined runner who makes all non-runners feel guilty about their lack of stamina, let me say this: I have never run that far in my life. I also had not run in weeks when this happened. Needless to say, I was shocked and a little proud and a lot sore for days… And then more days. I like having time to get a little lost in small cities that I don't know well. Cities like Columbia are fairly easy to figure out as far as direction and navigation go. Running and finding my way help me to get a better grasp on my surroundings and my sense of direction in a new place.

    <p>As far as cities go, Columbia is tiny. In some ways I imagine it’s easy to have a sense of belonging in a small city, where everyone knows (or at least know of) everyone else. In other ways, especially for transplants, I imagine it can difficult to find that sense. Even if everyone knows of you and is friendly enough, they know of you as the new person in town; most people already have their lives and schedules moving in place. When you’re comfortable yourself, it’s hard to see an opportunity to help someone else be comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing about small cities: the local scene is hard to miss. This is probably not true with every city, but it is definitely apparent in Columbia. The local force is strong in this one. Food businesses like Uprise and Donut Place are popular and thriving. Costume shop, consignment store, and yoga studio are all locally owned businesses that do well in this little place. In larger cities, the local scene is not always easy for a traveler to discover. Everything is so big, how can you tell what is special about just this place? I’ve found that the authentic community spaces and enterprises are much more easily-determined in places like Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>Like other cities well-connected to nature and agriculture, CoMo also has a lot of neat parks and farms nearby. Monica interned at one of these farms and knows all the hot nature/agriculture spots around. Goatsbeard Farm was right in the throes of kidding season when I was visiting, and Monica offered to take me out there for a visit. Kids were everywhere! A dream I did not know existed came true that day: I was tackled by a gaggle/flock/swarm of little, baby, goat animals!

    <p>And this moment made my life more complete. Monica is a gem for showing me around the city she calls home and for being one of those “almost-complete-opposites attract” friends. If you are ever in Columbia, hit her up and buy her a donut.
