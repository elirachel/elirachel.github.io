    <p>I didn’t spend much time here and so cannot say much about the city itself, but the babies here were darn cute!

    <p>The Buckley family kindly hosted me for an evening and a morning on my way up to Chicago. I got to stretch out some of that nine-mile run at a yoga-flow-movement-something class with Alyssa (refreshing). Cuddled and played with some sweet babes (#babytourusa). And, I tried eggs benedict for the first time. I love condiments and sauces; I joke that I eat french fries just as a vessel for ketchup (it’s completely true). I am also convinced that eggs should be the base of the food pyramid. Eggs benedict is defined by hollandaise sauce and eggs, so I’m not sure how I’ve missed out on this one for so long.
    </p>
    <p>After I said goodbye to the wonderfully welcoming Buckleys, I picked up my first rideshare passenger. Yes, I found a stranger online (Ridester) who needed a ride from Champaign to Chicago and told him I’d meet him at Starbucks. He gave me a tank of gas, I gave him a lift to the airport. It worked out really well, and for all you worriers out there, I’m still alive and well and even better for the experience.
    </p>
    <p>This guy was from Eastern Europe, had a very strong accent and an even stronger smell. I’m fairly certain he was running from the authorities. When I asked to take a picture of his ID to send to my sister (which is how I do possibly dangerous things safely), he was really hesitant. I ended up sending his email and Facebook info to her. He was very nice, respectful, and barely talked. I tried asking him some questions about himself and his travels, but he was not really interested in talking. So, I obliged and turned on my music. An hour into our trip, he asked if he could connect his music. Some interaction! Some clue into this person’s life! Of course you can! We listened to the same 5 minute EDM track on repeat for more than 30 minutes. I can still hear it playing over in my head.
    </p>
    <p>I dropped him off at the airport in Chicago, wished him luck, and went on my merry way… never to hear that track again.
