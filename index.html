        <p>I spent much of today playing with babies. One of them spent a few hours trying to launch himself off the steps of a concrete patio. [insert concrete baby photo] Another started to get upset and decided that yoga was an appropriate way to respond. [insert yoga baby photo] Yet another stuck his head under this little door; he was really trying to get through, just thought it was cool to put his head under a door. [insert door baby photo]

        <p>No, I don't know any families here, so it is reasonable for you to ask where I found these babes. What kind of parents are handing their kids off to a nomadic stranger?
        </p>
        <p>While in Portland, I'm a temporary nanny. When I was "planning" my month here, I was expecting to sustain myself with my savings and maybe some online tutoring. Perhaps a job at a restaurant here if I felt I really needed to. I spent a little time on Care.com looking for some childcare gigs, but not many people are looking for a nanny for the one month of April. There was only one family that I found. I applied and got the best response from them I could have hoped for, though I didn't know it at the time. They had already put down a deposit for a daycare, unfortunately, BUT they liked my application so much that they forwarded it to another family and recommended me to NorthWest Nannies.

        <p>I applied to be a temporary nanny with NWN and heard back from them within a week. After a quick conversation and a phone interview, I had a job in Portland for the month! They were so professional and proactive about hiring me and setting me up with jobs. I had my first gig only a few days after I arrived and my second, third, fourth, and fifth before the end of my first full week. I am excited about this for many reasons.

    <p>I’ve driven this way before with my bud, Emily. May 2014, right after I graduated, we started in New York, took a quick tour out to some southwestern states, and looped back around to my family in Oklahoma. I missed her so much along this journey! Though they were nice enough, I found my Ridester passengers’ company to be much less stimulating than hers was.
    </p>
    <p>Actually, after we dropped J off in Boise, I got really sick of B. Everything he did and said annoyed the tar out of me. Not that he changed at all, necessarily; I was just done being in the car and bored of him, which is my personality more than any fault of his. So, I dropped him off really quick at his hostel and tried to be polite in my farewell.
    </p>
    <p>“Hit me up if you want to hang out before you leave Portland!” he called as he shut the back, passenger-side door.
    </p>
    <p>“Alright! Have a nice life!” I returned as I actually thought, “Hell no way am I contacting you again, Felicia.”
    </p>
    <p>I zipped back over the bridge to my new home in NE Portland. No bust here; I made it to Oregon.
