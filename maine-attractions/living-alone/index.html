        <p>Being alone sucks.
        </p>

        <p>There. I said it. With all the confident independence I claim, I'm still very dependent on good, human company. Animals don't cut it for me. I like dogs and goldfish as much as the next person, but I need the verbal response and affirmation that I only understand through human languages. Books, movies, and internets don't cut it either. Sure, there are real people behind those things, but I need the physical and present being next to me. There's just something about social interactions that drives me to do more, be better, and generally love life. This social drive could easily be translated to represent some innate insecurity or shallow show of mine, but I'd rather think of it as a very natural expectation for an average human being. My extroverted needs are, perhaps, more pronounced than some. Everyone has their balance, and no one wants to be alone always. Biologically, humans need other humans to survive. I want to be alone almost never.
        </p>
        <p>So, if you can imagine, living alone in my sweet little beach hut has been a bit of a struggle. A very privileged struggle, albeit, but a still a struggle. The following is a list of things I start to do when I've been alone for too long:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <ul class="center-block">
          <li>Shower to some extreme. Either twice a day or not at all.</li>
          <li>Cook for the whole family. As if making enough food will bring the people running.</li>
          <li>Scream. Usually at nothing.</li>
          <li>Wear the same clothes for a week.</li>
          <li>Stop wearing clothes at all.</li>
          <li>Spend too much time practicing my headstands. I know it's too much because of the color of my face.</li>
          <li>Talk to myself in a singing voice, narrating my own solitary actions. Sometimes I even attempt opera.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Now that I'm getting better at selfies, I do that too. With raisins as my teeth.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <img src="/images/maine/maineraisins.JPG" alt="Raisins for teeth." style="width:450px; height:600px" class="image img-responsive center-block">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>I know that being alone is supposed to be good for reflection and personal growth, but I'm not so sure how much growth I can do at one time. And I'm not sure I want to reflect by myself yet. Living in a hospital away from my friend support system, being a caretaker for my brothers, and grieving with my family over Adam's lost independence has been hard. And even with so much love and support, I spent more time alone and reflecting during those eight months than I ever have. I went to Oregon because I didn't know anyone there who would ask how I was doing or how my family's getting along. Now, I'm alone, and no one is around to ask those questions, which means there's also no one to distract me from asking those questions myself.
        </p>
        <p>Being alone is good sometimes. Although I am perfectly capable of doing so, and I know plenty of people who prefer to have all the living space to themselves, I know that living on my own is not a goal of mine. If I'm consistent in one place for more than a couple weeks, I like to know I'm also consistently sharing life with another person. I like the comfort of knowing another person's schedule and living habits. I like having someone in the next room to call when there's a dead mouse in the closet. I like sharing furniture and kitchen utensils and space. Plus, cooking for more than one person is so much easier and more motivating. For now, I can handle a few weeks with my own space. Although, family and friends have plans to visit here, and I'll be traveling around again for a couple weekends in the near future (back to Buffalo for a party and then to NYC to look at sublets).
        </p>
        <p>I'll keep learning the balance of alone time and together time. It's an important trait to have, balance. But I'll always be sure to have some roommates around for any extended living plans.
        </p>
        <p>xo, Eli</p>
