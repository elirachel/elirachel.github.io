        <p>Day two is still all about exploring, getting used to my surroundings, and learning how to navigate my neighborhood and this city. Besides walking and biking, running is a great way for me to gather my sense of place. I find that running in a new city is also less of an exercise and more of an experience. I'll stop and look at anything, just the way I would if I were walking. It's just a little faster. During my run today, I stopped at a nearby park, where a dog ran with me for a bit, and at the <a href="http://www.albertagrocery.coop/">Alberta Co-op Grocery</a> around the corner from my house, where I picked up some groceries before heading back to my house to clean up. Like the rest of the local hippies, I love me some good, co-operative eggs.
        </p>
        <p>To continue my neighborhood explorations, I hopped over to <a href="http://casestudycoffee.com/">Case Study Cafe</a>. They are so serious about coffee there that I felt the need to apologize for ordering tea instead. I'm telling you, I get real crazy real fast after a few sips of the liquid. I spent some time in the loft there basking in the warm breeze that entered by way of the open garage door at the front of the building (how long have garage-businesses been a thing?). The weather has been unusually warm for this time of year, for which I take full credit. I wrote all my thank you notes for the friends I've stayed with along my travels thus far.
        </p>
        <p><img src="/images/pnw/thankyous.JPG" alt="Thank yous." style="width:500px; height:643px" class="img-responsive center-block"
        <p>In the middle of my note to Monica, a fellow I had noticed as the only other person in the loft area when I sat down approached me and asked where I got my notecards; he recently moved here and wanted to send letters to his family/friends. I told him I had made mine but recommended the art store I had discovered the day before for a good selection of artsy hand-made cards. He thanked me and started to leave. Thinking this could be a great opportunity to make a friend, I caught his attention again by mentioning that I had just moved here too. We talked for a bit about where we were from, blah blah blah. Then, he invited me to go swing dancing with him. He says it's a fun way to meet people. I think meeting a stranger in a coffee shop is more fun, but I'll go anyway. He's got broad shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>After crafting all my cards and envelopes to send across the USA, I wound up at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/">JavaScript study group Meetup</a>. I should start by thanking my pal, <a href="http://baugues.com/">Greg</a>, for introducing me to coding and for setting me up with my first resources here in Portland. I'm totally into it right now (just simple front-end development stuff at the moment, but maybe I'll be a real programmer someday [hashtag:nerdgoals]), and I figured it would be a great thing to learn while I'm travelling around anyway. And, look! I made my own website, where I can post my writing and adventures! Anyway, what was supposed to be a study group ended up being private beginner lesson with me and the woman who facilitates the Meetups, which was probably the most helpful thing that could have happened for me. She helped me get this site started and explained a few basic, overarching concepts about computers to me. It's a bummer that no one else was around to enjoy working/learning/coding together. Next time!
        </p>
        <p>To cap my second, full day in Portland, I met up with some AmeriCorps Buffalo friends. I noticed a photo that Marshay and Mikey posted on Instagram, noting that they were up here for spring break. How fun! I met them at Voodoo Donuts, where they were enjoying the famous pastry, and we walked around downtown for a while before finding some food at some bar. I wasn't super close with either of them when we were in Buffalo, but meeting them again as fellow travellers was totally cool. We have plans to visit Multnomah Falls together this weekend.
        </p>
        <p>Cheers to meeting new people and old acquaintances!</p>
        <p>xo, Eli</p>
