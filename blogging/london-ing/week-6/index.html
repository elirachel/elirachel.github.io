      <div class="row">
        <p>How has this week been the worst and best week so far? I feel like my world has been such a roller coaster – the lows have been so low, and the highs reach the sky. One moment I’m on top of the world, the next I’m ready to move to a deserted island and forget everything and everyone I know. This is a fairly typical pattern, but it seems slightly more intense since moving here.
        </p>
        <p>Classes were amazing and made me ready to conquer all the injustices in education with my fellow classmates and researchers. I started to get down when I was looking for jobs and finding that my visa restrictions were highly undesirable. Got a couple of babysitting gigs with a woman I’ve been in touch with since this summer; she invited me to live with her. I declined because I already have a home. Even with a little extra cash flow, finances started freaking me out. Got back up with a successful flat-warming party with my housemates. So many new friends, and I remember all their names. Back down with achy muscles, feverish nights, and a sore throat. I was in tears from the pain when I walked to urgent care Tuesday morning and snapped at my concerned housemates when they tried to help me. I turn into such a beast when I can’t control my physical pain. Even further down being in bed for two full days. Up a little when my fever broke. On a cloud with discussions of Foucault and education and power relations in class on Wednesday night. Decided to reconsider the woman’s offer to live in Highgate in exchange for occasional childcare and housesitting. High over the weekend after spending time with one of her daughters and agreeing to live with them. I’m moving in at the end of October. Currently, I am still high on that event.
        </p>
        <p>I have associated each high and low with an event here, but that isn’t always the case. Sometimes I get stuck in my head and bring myself down. Sometimes I get stuck in my head and can take on the world. Some consistency in life would be nice.
        </p>
        <p>At this very moment, I am content and feel productive. Writing and listening to The Avett Brothers in my empty flat with the sun’s light barely shining through London’s grey skies. I sent out a letter of interest to an ESOL association that works with refugees I want to volunteer with. Their work is inspired by Paolo Freire, who also happens to be one of the loves of my academic life (I am polyamorous in my academic love, so I won’t pretend he’s the only one.) Through critical conversations and student-led learning, they want to make social change for refugees in London. Even the thought of it is bringing back life to my forgetful soul.
        </p>
        <p>I think that’s where some of this week’s breakdowns have come from as well. I feel like my soul has forgotten what it loves. I’ve been out of academia and education for so long; my mind and heart are having a hard time getting back in. Maybe they aren’t the cause of my falling apart, but a lack of purpose and sight has definitely been brought to the forefront of my mind in the past week. I’ve been able to dismiss it pretty easily over the past two years or so by staying busy in other ways and disconnecting. Now that I’m back in conversations each week surrounding power relations, social justice, education, systemic issues, social positioning, privileges, etc., I can’t run away from it anymore. I don’t want to either. I want time and space to uncover my place in all of this. I need the tools provided in education to discover the most effective ways I can be involved and make changes. I have places to get specific, even though this paragraph is not one of them.
        </p>
        <p>I had a lot of expectations for myself when I first got here. Getting an active, thoughtful, well-rounded life put together in the first month. A month is enough time to figure out your life in a new place, right? Wrong. Well, wrong for me at least. A lot of things happened that I didn’t expect to happen, and I didn’t accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish before school started. But it’s OK. I’m still OK. Sometimes you don’t reach your goals when you think you should (maybe because they are kind of vague and you aren’t good at setting goals), and that’s OK. Being flexible is more important. Knowing where you are at the present moment and being able to readjust your expectations is what will keep you moving ahead. Recognizing the goodness in the surprise twists and turns is what gives you hope for whatever is next. Reflecting and reevaluating keep you in a constant state of growth, a constant state of change. Goals aren’t freedom. Change is freedom.
