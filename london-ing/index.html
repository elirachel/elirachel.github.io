        <h4>London-ing</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom:90px">London, baby. It's where it's all at. I'm now including myself in "it all". London is where I'm at, and I'm here all year! I'm studying at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe">Institute of Education</a> with University College London, getting my Master's of Arts in Sociology of Education. If you're thinking about studying in London, I'll be adding a section with some posts and insights into student life soon. I'll also be keeping track of my reflections on the contents of my courses, so look out for that. But for now London-ing is the day-to-day adventures, the extraordinary and the mundane. All the mundanity is extraordinary when you're living in London.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Those Damn Jets.</h3>
        <p>I'm here. It feels normal and right, but I still don't believe it sometimes. The flight here was exhausting. Luckily, I have amazing Camp America friends who picked me up at the airport, fed me, and kept me awake through the day to help with jet lag...<a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-1"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Flats Will Be Flats.</h3>
        <p>Oh my, oh my. This flat-hunting business is shite. It seems totally random how places are priced. Some nice places near tube stations are relatively affordable. Some trash spots further away are the same price. Sometimes the size of the place matters, sometimes it doesn't. And none of the pictures are ever true to what you'll actually see. You never know... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-2"> Read</a>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">On the Up.</h3>
        <p>I'm not on any drugs, so I'm not sure what's kept me going at this rate for the past three weeks. Through jet lag and sickness and flat hunting, how am I accomplishing as much as I am? The city rush? Excitement of something new? Adrenaline? My theory is that it's a combination of all these things with a strong helping of supporting characters to push me along - all my flatmates and friends... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-3"> Read</a>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">And Down.</h3>
        <p>After that last optimistic and energetic post, I'll be honest and say that I crashed this week. Especially at the beginning of the week, I didn't go very far from my home. It's been nice to walk around my neighborhood though. My Oyster card ran out of gas on Sunday and I didn't even try to refill it until Thursday - that's how dedicated I was to walking everywhere... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-4"> Read</a>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Back 2 Skool.</h3>
        <p>Classes start this week. This is why I'm here; I have to remember that. I've been here a month already, making friends, exploring the city, making a home; now, it's time to buckle down and get back to being a student. Back to constant readings to be done, obsessive thoughts about my course contents, countless ideas for research which turn out to have already been done, aha moment after aha moment, frustration at the fact that I don't know what I'll do with all this information, procrastination. Always procrastination... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-5"> Read</a>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Stabilizing Change.</h3>
        <p>How has this week been the worst and best week so far? I feel like my world has been such a roller coaster – the lows have been so low, and the highs reach the sky. One moment I’m on top of the world, the next I’m ready to move to a deserted island and forget everything and everyone I know. This is a fairly typical pattern, but it seems slightly more intense since moving here... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/london-ing/week-6"> Read</a>
