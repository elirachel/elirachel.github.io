        <p>Despite the fact that the food was not particularly appetizing, I had two meals on a six-hour flight with Norwegian Air. (Tiny red spoon included!) The flight here was exhausting; my wings were tired. Luckily, I have amazing Camp America friends who picked me up at the airport, fed me, and kept me awake through the day to help with jet lag. Sweet, sweet Leigh Sweeny. Despite our efforts, the jet lag really got me this time. I was awake for over 24 hours. For the first five days, I did not sleep for more than three hours at a time, waking up at 1:00am to stare at the ceiling for four hours every night before getting another three hours of sleep in. The lack of sleep shot my immune system, and I picked up a bit of a cold. It’s worth it, though; I’m here for a long time. A whole year!

        <p>After all the traveling I've been doing around the US, living in places so temporarily that I barely had time to unpack, I'm now looking for an apartment in London. I've only done any real house hunting once before (when I moved to Brooklyn for a month). Every other place I've been, I've already had a home set up for me. Now I'm in a different country. Still houseless. But now I'm really settling down. To most people, a year is not considered such, but a year is the longest I've been in one place since I moved away from my parents in OK. So this is all new to me.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily, London is not entirely new to me. I studied here with Houghton College's FYHP in 2011. That was the first time I'd ever lived in a big city or been out of the US and only a few months after first moving away from my family. I learned a lot in that semester. I don't remember most of the facts or conclusions or figures. I do remember developing my critical thinking skills and my independence and my ability to synthesize. I remember learning how to navigate a city on my own. I remember learning that my thoughts are valuable in academia, if not for the content then for the sake of dialogue. Questions had always been a part of my personal discourse, but London is where I learned about resources other than my family and religion. It's also where I found that questions are most valuable when they lead to more questions.
        </p>
        <p>I've got complaints about my alma mater, but this program in London is not one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back to today. I'm here. Feels good. Stressing only a little about finding a place to sleep and eat and store my things while I'm here. Dear Meg and her lovely roommates in Balham have been incredibly hospitable and are putting me up until I find my own house. I don’t want to put them out for too long, but I'm not worried yet. I've been getting over jet lag and hunting for flats and sorting some university issues out for a week now. My excitement over being here has me in a positive state of mind; I know I'll have it all figured out before classes start.
        </p>
        <p>xo, Eli</p>
