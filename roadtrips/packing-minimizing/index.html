      <h3 class="col-md-12 text-center">Packing and Minimizing</h3>
    </div>

        <p>Packing is a task that elicits conflicting emotions in people. It typically is associated with one, some, or all of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving</li>
          <li>Travelling</li>
          <li>Organizing</li>
          <li>Purging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Different folks have different feelings about each of these. I feel great about all three, so it makes sense that I enjoy packing. I started packing for my trip the day I got back to OK, a month before I was to leave. Packing is like a game I can play with myself. It's challenging to think, how little can I actually bring? What do I need, and what do I want?
        </p>
        <p>Minimizing and purging is an even more intense version of the game. It's more terminating. Do I really need this? If the answer is negative, it doesn't come with me.
        </p>I usually find that saying “no” to stuff is empowering. “No, I'm not dependent on that belly dancing video tutorial I never opened or even on the sweater I wear twice a week. And neither of those things need me.” I very rarely go back and wonder where that sweater is. I don't miss my stuff, and it's totally liberating. Because I have less, I am free to move around quickly and effortlessly. It feels like a small burden is lifted each time I get rid of something. The only thing I can't quite seem to let go of are my books… And I have several shelves worth. For now, they keep me grounded, keep me coming back. If I ever end up settling down, I want a room dedicated to books (a library, if you will). If I don't, I'll decided at some point in the future what to do with all those paperbacks and hardcovers.
        </p>
        <p>Besides the piles of books I have stored in various parts of the country, my whole life fits into the trunk of my Corolla. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sewing machine and quilting supplies</li>
          <li>Guitar</li>
          <li>Huge duffel bag of clothes and shoes for all seasons and occasions</li>
          <li>A box of miscellaneous stuff (books I'm currently reading, pens and markers, essential personal hygiene supplies, etc.)</li>
          <li>A couple blankets, including the one I got in New Mexico with Joyce and Emily on our graduation road trip.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wonder if it might have been good to only keep clothing that is appropriate for the current season and just switch out as the next comes along, but I don't think I would care to put that much effort into a constant clothing cycle. It worked out well enough that I have warmer clothes for early spring in Portland and more summer appropriate clothing for when I'm in Maine (and wherever else I’ll be after that!). I like to stick with basics (leggings) and add variety to it (patterns). My nonchalance about matching and coordinating also behooves me, though for people who do care, I would recommend avoiding articles of clothing that only support one outfit. If I discover later that I have changed my mind about anything, there are also plenty of opportunities for revision: buying, selling, trading. Clothes are sold everywhere, and it's fun to be able to say, “Oh, these green gloves? Yeah, I got them at a little shop in London.” I've always bought most of my clothing at thrift stores or traded at clothing swaps, and I recently sold a box of clothing for the first time. It was awesome! I used the letgo app to post a box of random clothes, and someone actually wanted it! It was great because she paid less than she would have at a thrift store, and I got a few extra bucks out of it. Clever.
        </p>
        <p>Generally speaking, keeping stuff to a minimum is, like most things in life, a matter of priorities. Freedom and movement are well above any physical possession to me, so purging just makes sense for me.
