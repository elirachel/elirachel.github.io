    <p>After a fantastic week in Chicago, my departure was bittersweet. I was excited to be back on the road, continuing my journey to the Pacific Northwest, but I will definitely miss those Chicago babes. Alas, the ongoing struggle of life on the road. As exciting as the next several days were on the road, I’ll only briefly outline them and highlight a few of the most interesting parts.
    </p>
    <p>I picked up my next Ridester passenger before leaving the city; we’ll call him B. He was pretty normal, and we had some good conversations right out of the gate. He was moving his whole life to Portland, just for kicks. All he had with him was a big backpack. Cool, dude. B was nice to have around, as he helped a little with the driving. Not too much though, since I like <strike>to be in control</strike> driving anyway.
    </p>
    <p>We stopped in Hastings, Nebraska, where my Uncle Jeff and Aunt Patrice live. It’s really nice to have them right there in the middle of the country as a homey rest during cross-country trips. I really enjoyed visiting with them, even for just a short time. I only felt a little bad that B felt obliged to sit and listen to all the family updates, but our family is fairly interesting, so I don’t think it was all that terrible. Even though we were out early the next morning, I managed to squeeze in two breakfasts. My uncle is too good of a cook for me to enjoy only one meal with him. Our next stop was a quick pick-up on the other side of Nebraska; that’s where J joined us.
    </p>
    <p>J needed a lift out to Boise for a week of concerts with his best buds. J sat in the back seat the whole time and barely said ten words outside of answers to my prying questions about his life. When I got bored of his short, non-descriptive answers, I left him alone. All around, he was the easiest passenger ever. If you ever find a rider like J, don’t hesitate to do him a favor and just throw him in the back seat. I don’t regret it.
    </p>
    <p>Before reaching Boise or Portland, I planned to spend Easter Sunday with my godparents in Salt Lake City. I told B and J to find their own accommodations there. I used some kind of “they don’t have much room and are always hosting people” excuse, which is true, but my real reason was I needed some space from these strangers and wanted time alone with Gregg and Yancey. I got what I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>SLC for Easter was full of delicious food, a superb hike around some mountains and snow, and a hilariously sarcastic local brewery.

    <p>I’ve driven this way before with my bud, Emily. May 2014, right after I graduated, we started in New York, took a quick tour out to some southwestern states, and looped back around to my family in Oklahoma. I missed her so much along this journey! Though they were nice enough, I found my Ridester passengers’ company to be much less stimulating than hers was.
    </p>
    <p>Actually, after we dropped J off in Boise, I got really sick of B. Everything he did and said annoyed the tar out of me. Not that he changed at all, necessarily; I was just done being in the car and bored of him, which is my personality more than any fault of his. So, I dropped him off really quick at his hostel and tried to be polite in my farewell.
    </p>
    <p>“Hit me up if you want to hang out before you leave Portland!” he called as he shut the back, passenger-side door.
    </p>
    <p>“Alright! Have a nice life!” I returned as I actually thought, “Hell no way am I contacting you again, Felicia.”
    </p>
    <p>I zipped back over the bridge to my new home in NE Portland. No bust here; I made it to Oregon.
