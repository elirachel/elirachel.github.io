        <p>I could live in Chicago. I say that about almost any city, simply because I'm a fan of that good ol' city life. But I especially like Chicago because some of my favorite people live there. It's not really "on the way" to Portland from Oklahoma, but I needed a quick fix before heading to an entirely unknown land, so I planned to spend a week in Chicago before venturing west. We packed a lot of good food and laughs and sights and hugs into one week; I'll just highlight a few moments and note a couple favorites.
        </p>
        <p>Traffic out of Portland was slow, but unless I've got some time constraints on my schedule, I'm usually not bothered by traffic. Plus, it was almost 90 degrees outside! What does it matter if I'm enjoying the sun in my car with the radio on (Beyonce has been my music kween of choice lately) or at my destination? Washington state looks mostly the same as Oregon state, as far as I could tell from the 3-hour drive between the two hip cities. I'm getting pretty good at driving long distances. Out of 10 levels, my driving stamina is probably an 8. I made up all the levels arbitrarily, so there's no way to prove objectivity. You really have no idea how my stamina is except that I'm satisfied with it.
        </p>
        <p>Upon arriving at my destination, I was greeted by a Daniel adult and a Thurman dog. Both were pleasant surprises and very welcoming. I was even more pleased to meet Alex, Daniel's adult girlfriend. She was out hunting for food, and when she got home, we prepared to eat it. The rest of the evening consisted of food, getting to know new (and re-new) friends, and making plans for the weekend. As always, I wanted to do everything, so Daniel suggested we do city stuff on Saturday and nature stuff on Sunday. Way to plan, Danny-boy! So, here's how our the wonderful Washington weekend turned out:
        </p>
        <h4>Saturday. Seattle. Sights in the city.</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, Alex had to work this morning, so Daniel and Thurman and I were on our own. We went out to Green Lake Park and walked around the lake. Gorgeous day, people everywhere, dogs all around.

        <p>After dropping Thurman off at the house, we found Alex at her restaurant after the lunch rush. Not that she owns a restaurant (though I wouldn't be surprised with how ambitious and determined she is); she just works there. Alex suggested we hit Pike Place Market as our first tourist stop so that we could have some time to walk around before vendors started closing down.

        <p>As confident and fearless as I claim to be, I am terribly jumpy. Very easily startled. Bike bells behind me send me into the nearest person's arms like Scooby Doo and Shaggy. The fishmongers held this monkfish (if it really is a monkfish) by a rope through the counter. When people got close to it, they would pull the string and make the fish jump at poor, curious bystanders... like me. I put Tony Hawk to shame with how much air I got; though the shame was mine after screaming in a crowded public space the way I did.

        <p>Seattle knows me because Seattle knows Orca whales. I actually almost moved here instead of Portland for this very reason. (Impetuousness brought me to Portland. I have no regrets.) I've always had very vivid dreams about Orcas, and they are fascinating creatures. My favorite book about the spiritual and communal beings is Listening to Whales by Alexandra Morton; if you're looking for some informative narrative work on Orcas, take my recommendation for this one. Anyway, I found this carving of a whale in Seattle, because whales are everywhere.
