    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>I'll probably say this many times because it feels so true to me: Travelling is a time warp. I don't understand how a week can feel so fast, while at the same time it seems I've been here forever. My guess is that it has to do with the fullness of my time. I've not been bored or lonely or without a fun activity to do at all since the beginning of my Portland trip a week ago. I suppose this theory could transfer to non-travelling time, but I'm convinced there's something magically and scientifically unique about exploring new places.
        </p>
        <p>On Friday, I met up with a dear friend of a dear friend. Rachel (also found in other posts) connected me with her friend Erica, who has been in Portland for a couple years now. Erica is better than Yelp. Even before we met for lunch at <a href="http://www.bipartisancafe.com/">Bipartisan Cafe</a>, she sent me a proper five-paragraph essay rating restaurants, organized by neighborhood, detailing the food restrictions to which they cater. (This is an exaggeration. But only slightly.) She's awesome, and I am so excited to get to know her a little more while I'm here. How happy to have good people in one's life! Meeting up with friends of friends is another favorite of mine. If you have a friend near me, I am always more than happy to meet up with them and deliver your greetings. I find that intersection of relationships fascinating. It's also fun to share nice things about someone you both love; what an uplifting way to connect.
        </p>
        <p>I got another chance to make a friend on Friday. Cheryl, my AirBnB host, joined me for tea at <a href="http://www.randomordercoffee.com/">Random Order Pie Bar</a>. A novel idea to me: pie bar. What?! I didn't actually eat pie, though. I have not-so-great feelings toward warm fruit, so most pies don't work for me. I also was still full from lunch. Maybe I'll go back for a custard pie another day. Their iced chai was my favorite so far, and the atmosphere was warm and bright, which is partly due to the AMAZING weather lately.

        <p>The next day was just as full of explorations and new-ish friends. I only recently got on Facebook and Instagram and am finding it so useful in my travels so far. I know I'm late, but I just didn't see how they would make my life better. Well, now I can say that they have. What a fantastic tool for making real life happen with people. Marshay and Mikey, friends from AmeriCorps in Buffalo, posted a Portland picture to the social media; when I saw it, I jumped at the chance to reconnect with them. We went out to Multnomah Falls on Saturday and had a great time walking around, taking pictures, picnicking, and looking at water falling over a cliff.

        <p>Water falling everywhere! And I was really digging the geometric patterns in those rocks. If I had paid more attention and retained more information in my Physical Geology class, I would be able to offer an educational snippet here. Alas, I did not. I just know some random facts about dinosaurs and living fossils.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, Sunday rolled around soon enough and my weekend was still going strong. If you read my <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/more-explore/">previous post</a> that mentions how I made a new friend, I'm sure you want to hear about how swing dancing went with my broad-shouldered buddy went. (He will henceforth be referred to as "BSB".) It was super fun. Whether you can dance or not, it really is a cool way to meet people in a new city, or an old city for that matter, I suppose. BSB did not impress me with his dancing skills becuase he has none. But, I am still impressed with his confidence in talking to women writing notes in coffee shops. If BSB can keep up, I think we'll have a grand time together this Portland month.
