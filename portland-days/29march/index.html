      <p>I’ve made it! Despite my long days of travelling and my lack of sleep, I woke up too early this morning in Oregon. All the time zone changes got me like, "Imma be an early bird and get that worm. Oh wait, the worms don't get out of bed before 5am." Anyway, I’m across the country, ready to explore this place. I chose Portland because it’s in this part of the country; I haven’t done much traveling in the Pacific Northwest yet. None at all, actually. I’m pretty proud of the list of States I’ve been to, but I haven’t touched the PNW until now. More by circumstance and distance than by any fault of the region. I’ll be visiting Seattle while I’m up here too, AND taking a northern route when I head back East. I’m gettin’ it all in.
      </p>
      <p>I’m particularly excited about the length of my stay here. I’m here for a month. I’m always disappointed at the end of visits because there is never enough time to do everything I want to do. But I also have so many places to see that I can’t spend too long in one spot, right? One month of straight-up exploring a place should satisfy me. My hope is that it gives me a chance to get to know more than just the must-see tourist attractions, though I’m not opposed to those. A month will give me a chance to analyze cultural differences, make friends, and familiarize myself with directions in the city (which is something that I find very empowering).
      </p>
      <p>My place in Portland is a gem. It’s a bright green house on a quiet little street in the Alberta Arts District (two blocks from Alberta Street itself). I live with Cheryl and Dustin and their almost-4-year-old son and Omen the cat. I’m renting a room in their home for my Portland month through AirBnB. This is my first trip booked through AirBnB, so I suppose I can’t promise this applies to all experiences, but this is amazing. Cheryl is a fabulous host, their bright, little room fits me perfectly. I have full access to the kitchen and living areas, including a washer and dryer. Cheryl even shares her homemade laundry soap!

      <p>Briefly, AirBnB is a site that connects travelers to hosts in cities around the world. It can be less expensive than a hotel or hostel and is meant to give travelers a more authentic, local experience. It’s a hell of a lot nicer to stay in a real home and neater to stay in a real neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>A whole month in this neighborhood and city means there’s no rush to see everything as soon as possible, but I managed to stay busy. There was not a moment of boredom or loneliness. I met with the Assistant Director of Northwest Nannies to go over some hiring paperwork. I found some work as a temporary nanny while I’m here, which I’ll write more about another time. We met at Barista on Alberta Street. I don’t drink coffee, but I love a good chai drink or some hot tea, and Barista’s chai and atmosphere were both satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>After that meeting I wandered around the area, stopping to look into anything that seemed interesting. I found a little art store called Collage and picked up some book-making tools (glue and a utility knife), but I was lost in there for a long time amongst the pens and papers, colors and shapes.

      <p>I eventually wandered home for lunch and found my neighbor sitting on her porch in the sunshine. We talked for a bit, and I mentioned how much I miss my bike now that I’m living in a bike-friendly city again. “How tall are you?” she asked. I told her my height and she told me that she might have a bike I could borrow. It’s perfect! A little janky, quite rusty. We had to grease up the chain, screw in the pedals, replace the handle grips, and tighten a few nuts and bolts. But overall, it is free and perfect for my one month in this city. She even had an extra cable, so all I need is a padlock.

      <p>Day one in Portland: a fantastically full first day.</p>
