      <p>Since I've begun this journey, which to me means even talking with people about planning it, lots of folks have commented on my bravery. In response to the first few comments of "Wow! I could never do that" and "It takes a lot of courage to do that alone", I just smiled and thanked them kindly. I didn't feel brave, but I must be if everyone said so, right? Maybe I'd start to feel it once my adventure really started, once I was out on the road. A few weeks in, I was still getting the generous compliment each time I shared my story. A few weeks in, I still didn't feel any braver than before. When talking to my new Portland friend, Lacey (an amazing woman who happens to be a programmer), about this discrepancy I was feeling, I realized I couldn't relate bravery to my travels because I felt no fear in my adventures - only excitement. Courage does not exist without fear. I felt no fear; I could not be brave.
      </p>
      <p>I could have very easily spiraled into questions of what I <i>should</i> do or be. Do the people who compliment me so expect me to be scared? Why would that be something people expect? Is it their own courage/fear they see reflected in my actions? Should I be worried about all the things they worry about for me? How effortless it is to fall into patterns of questioning my own motives and others' expectations!
      </p>
      <p>Before I could get lost in these thoughts or even tuck them away for further reflection, Lacey asked a question that stopped me.</p>
      <p>What's <i>your</i> brave?</p>
      <p>What a beautifully simple and thoughtful question. I paused for a moment before answering, but it didn't take much time for me to know the answer for myself.</p>
      <p>In July 2015, my oldest, smallest, younger brother had a heart transplant. The hope that comes with a successful operation and the possibilities that come with renewed health were all crushed by a little blood clot that found its way to his brain, a severe brain injury that left him in a semi-vegetative state. Half of my life was already packed since I had been planning a year-long trip to Australia, so a week in Buffalo, NY, packing (and trashing) the rest of my junk gave me plenty of time to move myself down to St. Louis, where Adam was hospitalized. I told my parents I’d stick with them through Adam’s in-patient stretches, however long that might be, and then for a month after he got home to help them all settle into new life with different abilities. The next eight months was an emotional and mental rollercoaster that somehow went down more often than it climbed up. Like a little kid who just can’t stand the injustice of limited playtime anymore, I very seriously considered running away more than once. (How hard could it be to just disappear, right?) In fact, I have a list now.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Excuses that might help you escape some family responsibilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get married (though I suppose you add other responsibilities with that one)</li>
            <li>Tell your Christian parents you have wholly converted to Islam</li>
            <li>Break a bone or two (I've been convinced this would work as an escape tactic since I was seven...)</li>
            <li>Get lost and let your smartphone die</li>
            <li>Go on a foreign missions trip</li>
            <li>Get pregnant</li>
            <li>Buy a home in another part of the country</li>
            <li>Become a recluse for religious reasons</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I didn’t end up doing any of those things, but I did consider each of them at some point. If you think loyalty is an admirable trait, give it up for my parents, who raised a kid who stayed in spite of her escapist tendencies. (Note: Adam has made incredible healing progress in the past several months, though. You can read more about his struggles and triumphs through my mom’s eyes on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamAdamWallace/">Team Adam Facebook page</a>.)

    <p>Countless times throughout those eight months, I just wanted to run. I wanted to turn away from the whole thing and pretend it had never happened, pretend that I could just move on with my adventures the way I had planned. I wanted to pretend so hard that it became reality. More than anything, I just wanted to run. But I didn't run. I stayed. And that was the bravest thing I've ever done, because that was the fiercest fear I've ever faced.</p>
    <p>Travelling is easy for me. Sure, there are bumps along every way that get my heart beating a little faster and make me question my sanity. But in general, exploring new places by myself or with others is a life-giving and very enjoyable experience. However, what's easy for me is not always what's easy for other people. Each person has their own kind of fear, and thus, their own kind of brave. Before you compliment a person on their bravery, reflect on your own brave. Then, ask them, "What's your brave?"
