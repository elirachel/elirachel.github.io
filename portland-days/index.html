        <h4>Portland Days of a Portland Month</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom:90px">I'm spending the month of April in Portland, Oregon, where cyclists and pedestrians are first-class citizens. I'm keeping track of the things I learn about this place from the people I meet and the opportunities I embrace. Apparently, donuts, beer, and coffee are Portlanders' three main food groups, and every successful restaurant here caters to all dietary preferences/restrictions. Although I can't bring myself to consume more than half a cup o' joe every six months, I imagine I'll fit in well enough in the City of Roses.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">First Full Day</h3>
        <p>I’ve made it! I’m across the country, ready to explore the Northwest. I chose Portland because it’s in this part of the country; I haven’t done much traveling in the Pacific Northwest yet. None at all, actually. I’m pretty proud of the list of States I’ve been to, but I haven’t touched the PNW until now... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/29march/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">More Explore (It rhymes.)</h3>
        <p>Day two is still all about exploring, getting used to my surroundings, and learning how to navigate my neighborhood and this city. Besides walking and biking, running is a great way for me to gather my sense of place... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/more-explore/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Temp Nanny Diaries</h3>
        <p>I spent much of today playing with babies. One of them spent a few hours trying to launch himself off the steps of a concrete patio. Another started to get upset and decided that yoga was an appropriate way to respond. Yet another stuck his head under this little door... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/temp-nanny-diaries/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Weekend in Portland</h3>
        <p>I'll probably say this many times because it feels so true to me: Travelling is a time warp. I don't understand how a week can feel so fast, while at the same time it seems I've been here forever. My guess is that it has to do with the fullness of my time... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/weekend-in-portland/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Brave</h3>
        <p>Since I've begun this journey, which to me means even talking with people about planning it, lots of folks have commented on my bravery. In response to the first few comments of "Wow! I could never do that" and "It takes a lot of courage to do that alone", I just smiled and thanked them kindly. I didn't feel brave, but I must be if everyone said so, right?... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/brave/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Seattle: Where Orcas are Gods.</h3>
        <p>When I was in Utah on my way out West, my godmother gave me contact information for her grandson, Daniel, who lives in Seattle. When we were kids, Daniel played with my siblings and me in my godparents' backyard on their rickety old playground. He and Brother Adam were best kid friends. You know, the kind of best friends who are such by parental connections and the ease of childhood. I mentioned wanting to see Seattle at some point during my PNW travels, and Yancey thought it would be a great idea for me to meet up with Daniel and his friends. She was certainly correct. It was a great idea... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/seattle/"> Read</a></p>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:-15px; margin-top:50px">Crater Lake... Or Not.</h3>
        <p>I grew up in mostly rural and small-town settings, but I'm a self-made city dweller. I could go on and on about the glories of city life - the closeness and excitement, the history and social structures, the convenience and options... I digress. However, the city often misses that power inside every person I have ever known that is drawn to nature and its elements. One of the notable things about Portland is its proximity to some incredible natural sights... <a href="http://elirachel.github.io/portland-days/crater-lake/"> Read</a></p>
