    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>I spent much of today playing with babies. One of them spent a few hours trying to launch himself off the steps of a concrete patio. Another started to get upset and decided that yoga was an appropriate way to respond. Yet another stuck his head under this little door; he was really trying to get through, just thought it was cool to put his head under a door.
        </p>
        <p>No, I don't know any families here, so it is reasonable for you to ask where I found these babes. What kind of parents are handing their kids off to a nomadic stranger?
        </p>
        <p>While in Portland, I'm a temporary nanny. When I was "planning" my month here, I was expecting to sustain myself with my savings and maybe some online tutoring. Perhaps a job at a restaurant here if I felt I really needed to. I spent a little time on Care.com looking for some childcare gigs, but not many people are looking for a nanny for the one month of April. There was only one family that I found. I applied and got the best response from them I could have hoped for, though I didn't know it at the time. They had already put down a deposit for a daycare, unfortunately, BUT they liked my application so much that they forwarded it to another family and recommended me to <a href="http://www.nwnannies.net/">NorthWest Nannies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I applied to be a temporary nanny with NWN and heard back from them within a week. After a quick conversation and a phone interview, I had a job in Portland for the month! They were so professional and proactive about hiring me and setting me up with jobs. I had my first gig only a few days after I arrived and my second, third, fourth, and fifth before the end of my first full week. I am excited about this for many reasons.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I was able to secure a job before I even got here.</li>
          <li>I don't work for the agency, just with them. No money paperwork, just an agreement. They find me work; I make sure they get the agency fee from the family. On a side note, this also means I had to provide my own background checks. Those could have cost me a pretty penny, but I fortunately was able to obtain mine from other companies I worked with and just sent them over to NWN. They now believe me when I say, “I'm not a criminal, but I do get caught speeding once in a while.”</li>
          <li>The families pay me directly and immediately. No waiting until the end of the week for a paycheck. This is especially great for traveling, since I don't have a permanent address for them to send to. And I want to spend the money on my current travels!</li>
          <li>I'm worth more than minimum wage to parents and the agency.</li>
          <li>The two women who run NWN have been absolutely amazing staying in touch with me. I'm not always easy to get a hold of, but they're great.</li>
          <li>I get to play with kids and hold babies, which are two of my favorite things.</li>
          <li>I see parts of the city I would not have explored otherwise and have quickly gotten a handle on directions around here.</li>
          <li>By the end of my Portland month, I'll have made enough to offset my housing, living, and entertainment costs.</li>
          <li>Most importantly to me, it's so flexible. They send jobs my way and I can take them or leave them. I'm only here for a month, and they're happy to have me anyway. It allows me to have fun and do the things I came here to do!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For any child-friendly person doing some long-stay traveling, I highly recommend this as a way of maintaining cost. And, I highly recommend NWN for nannies and families in the Portland area.
        </p>
        <p>xo, Eli</p>
