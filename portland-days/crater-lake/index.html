    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>I grew up in mostly rural and small-town settings, but I'm a self-made city dweller. I could go on and on about the glories of city life - the closeness and excitement, the history and social structures, the convenience and options... I digress. However, the city often misses that power inside every person I have ever known that is drawn to nature and its elements. One of the notable things about Portland is its proximity to some incredible natural sights. There are countless outdoor opportunities over here. If you are into forest scenes as much as I am, you'll get along well. I'm certain my spirit ecosystem is a northern forest, some place with woodland creatures, tall trees covered in vines, and mulchy moss underfoot.
        </p>
        <p>So, a trip out to Crater Lake (a natural wonder!), driving through Mt. Hood National Forest sounded like a great way to spend my next weekend in the PNW. I hit up my BSB for a travel companion, and he was game, as always. I packed some foodstuffs; he planned some stops along the way. We were ready to find the lake that was not made by a crater, but rather a volcano - road trip! We planned to get out to Bend, Oregon by Saturday evening with plenty of time along the way to pull over whenever something worth exploring caught our attention. Good travel companions are the ones that equal your own levels of adventure and curiosity, the ones that are just as laid-back and easy-going. The especially best kind are the ones that take any surprise change of plans with grace and excitement.

        <p>We discovered this little gem of a fortress at the beach by the river. I have found, especially during this Portland month, many crooks and crannies that perfectly fit around my self. Of course, if you can fit in a tree or a cave or a statue or a fortress - really anything, then it seems most appropriate to climb inside that thing. Thank you, whoever built this structure, for creating a space for me. You passed this way and left joy in your wake. You remind me that my own creations are my legacy, and my words and actions and relationships are my own creations. Though, creatorship is never entirely independent and always collaborative in one way or another.

      <div class="row">
        <p>As fun and exploratory as all this was, the adventure really began when, out of nowhere, we were stopped by several inches of snow on the road. The sun was shining, the air was warm; we had no reason to expect snow. You know, except for the ominous warnings of Oregon natives, who apparently knew better than we innocent, bright-eyed babes. We tried, probably foolishly, to just drive through it. Alas, 3-5 inches of slushy, snowy junk is not compatible with your run-of-the-mill... whatever kind of car. After a brief "shit, we're stuck" moment, we backed out of the snow and stopped to look at a map.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, we can turn around, drive an hour back out of the forest, and take the highway a few hours out to Bend... Or, we could go back about half-way and try to take this other forest road out to the highway."
        </p>
        <p>We chose the second option. Sure, we got almost got stuck in snow on one of these forest roads, but why not try again? So, we found the only other forest road that was shown on the map and ventured out. We came to an unexpected fork in the road, and both of our instincts said to go to the right. Before BSB made the turn, a frantic woman came at us from the left, waving and yelling. Mind you, we are in the middle of nowhere and have seen very few people on this road. My immediate thought was, "Stop! Woman in danger! Gotta help her!" We rolled down the window as she came up to our car. Desperate and frazzled, she blurted her whole story as soon as she reached us.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! I am so happy to see you; I have been walking for hours and haven't seen a single person since I left my car and my husband. My phone is at 1% and 911 won't help me; I can't get a hold of a tow truck. Our car got stuck in the snow out down that way, and I've been walking for miles. Can you please help me??" (etc.)
        </p>
        <p>Being the averagely compassionate human beings that we are, we of course told her to hop in. We picked up her husband, who had started walking the same road a little after she did and wasn't too far behind. They had come across the same snow we had earlier and had made the same decision about how to proceed to Bend. As grateful as they were to us for rescuing them, I think they saved us in a big way, too. Unfortunately, our cars weren't compatible for towing (as far as any of us knew), and they were far enough into the snow that we were certain we wouldn't be able to get them out. It was getting close to sundown, so we agreed to drive them out of the forest (back the way we came) so that they could find a place to stay and a tow truck in the morning. On that long journey out of the woods they told us their love story, which was long and full of sadness and beautiful, and the woman, who turned out to be an optometrist, offered to set me up with a year's supply of contacts and to fix BSB with a new pair of glasses. So generous! We were pumped to share our contact information with her. They also shared the location of a hot spring they had enjoyed that morning as a part of their weekend getaway. I felt bad that their weekend had taken such a terrible turn after how highly they spoke of the springs. BSB and I looked at each other and thought the same thing: After all the driving and the twists and turns of events, hot springs sounded like the best option for concluding our day, even if it meant we didn't get out to Crater Lake.
        </p>
        <p>We dropped them off at a little hotel outside of the forest and drove back in to find the blessed spring. It was dark and secluded, but there were plenty of people there once we found it. The rest of the night included BSB saving me from boiling to death, because I was so comfortable in the heat, and sleeping in the back of his car with no sleeping supplies, because we were not prepared to rough it out. The next morning included an average breakfast in that forest town and the decision to go back to the city. BSB would have been up for some hiking, but I was already missing the concrete and the bridges and the parks. So, we visited the International Rose Garden and the Japanese Gardens in Washington Park; we biked across bridges and around the city; we found ice cream at <a href="http://saltandstraw.com/">Salt & Straw</a> (Thanks to Erica for the recommendation!). We decided that despite the drastic changes in our plans, the weekend turned out to be a great one. I decided that I'd be happy to travel with a flexible, adventurous, easy-going partner like BSB anyday.
